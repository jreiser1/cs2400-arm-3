		;		ARM Programming Assignment #3: 32 bit IEEE 754 single-precision multiplier
		;
		;		Write a 32-bit floating point multiplier. The numbers will be represented
		;		in the single-precision IEEE 754 floating-point standard. The result should
		;		also be in IEEE 754 binary32. Assume you only have normalized numbers, i.e.
		;		the exponent is never 0b00000000.
		;		Write the result in the provided "fill" word.
		
		;		Your code here
		
floats	DCD		0xa0bcff0d, 0x13c0adea
result	FILL		8
